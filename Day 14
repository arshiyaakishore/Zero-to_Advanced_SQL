Example:
Create a stored procedure named "get_customer_orders" that takes a customer ID as input and retrieves all the orders placed by that customer.

Practice Questions:
1. Create a trigger named "update inventory" that automatically updates the quantity in the "inventory" table when an order is placed.
2. Create a user-defined function named "calculate_discount" that takes the order total as input and returns the discount amount based on specific conditions.
3. Write a SQL query to optimize a slow-performing query by adding appropriate indexes and rewriting the query structure.
