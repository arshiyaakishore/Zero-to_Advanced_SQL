Example:
Write a SQL query to start a transaction, update the "inventory" table by reducing the quantity of a product, and commit the transaction.
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE inventory
SET quantity = quantity - quantity_to_reduce
WHERE product_id = your_product_id;
COMMIT;



Practice Questions:
1. Write a SQL query to start a transaction, delete all records from the "orders" table, and roll back the transaction.
2. Write a SQL query to update the "balance" column of the "accounts" table by adding a specific amount for a specific account, ensuring the consistency of the transaction.
3. Write a SQL query to lock a specific row in the "employees" table to prevent other transactions from modifying it.

BEGIN TRANSACTION;
DELETE FROM orders;
ROLLBACK;


BEGIN TRANSACTION;
DECLARE @account_id INT;
DECLARE @amount DECIMAL(10, 2); -- Replace with your specific data
SET @account_id = 123; -- Replace with the specific account ID
SET @amount = 100.00; -- Replace with the specific amount to add
UPDATE accounts
SET balance = balance + @amount
WHERE account_id = @account_id;

COMMIT;


BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE employee_id = 123
FOR UPDATE;
