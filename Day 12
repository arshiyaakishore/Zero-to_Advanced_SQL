Example:
Write a SQL query to retrieve all employees and their respective managers from the "employees" table using a self-join.

SELECT
    e.employee_id AS employee_id,
    e.employee_name AS employee_name,
    m.employee_id AS manager_id,
    m.employee_name AS manager_name
FROM employees e LEFT JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id;


Practice Questions:
1. Write a SQL query to retrieve all the orders that do not have any corresponding items in the "order_items" table using a subquery.
2. Write a SQL query to retrieve all the products along with the total quantity sold for each product from the "products" and "order_items" tables using a join and subquery.
3. Write a SQL query to retrieve all the customers who have placed an order in the same month and year as their registration date

SELECT *FROM orders WHERE order_id NOT IN (SELECT order_id FROM order_items);

SELECT p.product_id, p.product_name, COALESCE(SUM(oi.quantity), 0) AS total_quantity_sold
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_id, p.product_name;


SELECT c.customer_id, c.customer_name, c.registration_date
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE DATE_FORMAT(o.order_date, '%Y-%m') = DATE_FORMAT(c.registration_date, '%Y-%m');
