Example:
Create a view named "high_salary_employees" that retrieves all the employees with a salary greater than 50000 from the "employees" table.

CREATE VIEW high_salary_employees AS SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;
--view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.
--view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.

Practice Questions:
1. Create a view named "order_summary" that retrieves the total order amount and the number of orders for each customer from the "orders" table.
2. Create an index on the "email" column of the "customers" table for faster searching.
3. Create a view named "product_inventory" that retrieves the product name and the available quantity for each product from the "products" and "inventory" tables.

CREATE VIEW order_summary AS SELECT customer_id, COUNT(order_id) AS number_of_orders, SUM(order_amount) AS total_order_amount FROM orders GROUP BY customer_id;
