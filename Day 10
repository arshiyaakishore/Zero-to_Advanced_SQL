Example:
Create a table named "employees" with columns for employee ID, name, and email, where the employee ID is the primary key and the email must be unique.

CREATE table employees( employee_ID INT PRIMARY KEY, name varchar(20), email varchar(250) UNIQUE);

Practice Questions:
1. Create a table named "orders" with columns for order ID, customer ID, and order date, where the order ID is the primary key and the customer ID references the "customers" table.
2. Create a table named "products" with columns for product ID, name, and price, where the product ID is the primary key and the price cannot be null.
3. Create a table named "categories" with columns for category ID and name, where the category ID is the primary key and the name must be unique.

CREATE TABLE orders( order_id INT PRIMARY KEY, customer_id INT, order_date DATE, FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id));

CREATE TABLE products (product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,name VARCHAR(255),price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL);
